1. Supervised learning models are programmed in Python using Jupyter notebook format(ipynb)
2. pre requisite to run the program if it is run in Local:
   Install the below mentioned libraries
   •	Scikit-learn
   •	Pandas
   •	Numpy
   •	Matplotlib
   •	Seaborn
   • 	Random
3. The Dataset diabetics.csv file should be kept in the same path folder as this code file, if not please give the path of dataset in variable 'pima'
4. Execute line by line to preprocess data, visualize, training the models and observe the evaluating metrics,
5. All three models Decision Tree, KNN and Logistics Regression are scripted in single file.
